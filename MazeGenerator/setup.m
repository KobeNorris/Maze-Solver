function [maze, nodes, position, endPos] = setup(size)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ENGR 132 Program Description
%	This function This function takes a size parameter and generates a nxn
%   matrix of that size. Next, the function creates a border of 8's around
%   the outside edges. It then randomly generates a start and end point
%   (which will be returned at the end of the function). The start point
%   will be located at some point along the bottom row (where it will
%   replace one of the 8's). The end point will be located at some point
%   along the top row (where it will replace one of the 8's). A 1 (path)
%   will be generated directly above the start point, and a node will be
%   created at that point. The function then returns the created maze, a
%   list of nodes, and the start/end positions of the maze.

%% INITIALIZATION ---
% Generate maze, create borders of 8s
maze = zeros(size);
maze(1, 1:end) = 8;
maze(1:end, 1) = 8;
maze(end, 1:end) = 8;
maze(1:end, end) = 8;

%% CALCULATIONS ---
% Generate random starting and ending points
position = point(size, randi([2 (size - 1)]));  % Generate a number >= 2 and <= size - 1
maze = setMazePosition(maze, position, 3);      % Set the END of the maze with (size, [2 - (size - 1)])
position = adjust(position, -1, 0);             % Move the point of END downward for 1 row
maze = setMazePosition(maze, position, 1);      % Set the point below END to Path
nodes(1, 1) = position.row;                     % nodes(1,1) stores the END Path row
nodes(2, 1) = position.col;                     % nodes(2,1) stores the END Path row                                           

endPos = point(1, randi([2 (size - 1)]));                                   % Generate a number >= 2 and <= size - 1 and point(1, randi)
maze = setMazePosition(maze, endPos, 4);                                    % Set the first row's point to 4 ????? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
