classdef point
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ENGR 132 Program Description
%	The purpose of this class is to prevent the need for x and y components
%   for all points throughout the maze. These functions are mostly one
%   liners whos purpose is to make adjustments to the maze and positions
%   simpler.
