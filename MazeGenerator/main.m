% ENGR 132 Program Description
%	This script is the main controller of the maze generation program.
%   This uses the setup function to create an empty maze. Then, it uses the
%   move function while there are no more nodes listed in the nodes list.
%   At the very end, it uses the adjustEnd function to link the exit to the
%   rest of the maze.

%% INITIALIZATION ---
% Grabs user input for size and difficulty
% Constraints for size: Positive number 5 < s < 100
% Constraints for difficulty: 1 < d < 10
res = inputdlg({'Enter size of maze:', 'Enter difficulty of maze:'}, 'Input', 1);
size = str2num(res{1});
difficulty = str2num(res{2});
% Verify numbers are correct
while size > 100 || size <= 5 || difficulty < 1 || difficulty > 10
    res = inputdlg({'Enter size of maze:', 'Enter difficulty of maze:'}, 'Incorrect Input', 1);
    size = str2num(res{1});
    difficulty = str2num(res{2});
end

%% CALCULATIONS ---
[maze, nodes, position, endPoint] = setup(size); % From 3 to 4£¬ 4 is endPoint
% Runs generation process until there are no more nodes left % Check whether the info of END has been put into the nodes array
% Jump out when nodes is empty
while numel(nodes) > 0
     % The position of START has been passed to this function
    [maze, position, nodes] = move(maze, position, nodes, difficulty);
    dispMaze(maze);
end
maze = adjustEnd(maze, endPoint);
