function [maze] = adjustEnd(maze, endPosition)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% ENGR 132 Program Description
%	This function This function connects the end piece to the rest of the
%   maze. Because the movement constraints are set to not directly touch
%   the border (8's), a connection must be made to the generated maze. This
%   is done by traversing straight down from the end position until a
%   connection has been made to the rest of the maze. This is indicated by
%   looking left, right, and down to see if there is a 1 next to it. This
%   outputs the adjusted maze at the end of this function.
%
% Function Call
%   function [maze] = adjustEnd(maze, endPosition)
%
% Input Arguments
%	1. maze: Current maze
%   2. endPosition: (point class) Position of end point
%
% Output Arguments
%	1. maze: Current maze

%% INITIALIZATION ---
% Set position below end point to be a 1 (start the connection process)
position = point(endPosition.row + 1, endPosition.col); % 从endPoint往下移一格
maze = setMazePosition(maze, position, 1); % 将此格设为Path
connection = 0;
while connection == 0
    % Search if there are any 1's in down, left, right positions 找有没有路过
    if mazeValue(maze, position, 1, 0) == 1 
        connection = 1;
    elseif mazeValue(maze, position, 0, -1) == 1
        connection = 1;
    elseif mazeValue(maze, position, 0, 1) == 1
        connection = 1;
    else
        % If there are no surrounding 1's, move down 若没有就继续往下走，直到找到为止
        position = adjust(position, 1, 0);
        maze = setMazePosition(maze, position, 1);
    end
end
